    /// A type describing a comment
    ///
    /// This model represents a single comment within a discussion thread, including
    /// identifiers, timestamps, author information, and the rich text content of the
    /// comment.
    ///
    /// Notion API documentation can be found at
    /// https://developers.notion.com/reference/comment-object
    ///
    /// Key characteristics:
    /// - object: Always "comment", matching the Notion APIâ€™s object discriminator.
    /// - id: A unique identifier for the comment.
    /// - parent: The parent context (database, data source, page, or workspace) where the
    ///   comment resides.
    /// - discussionID: Identifier linking this comment to a broader discussion thread.
    /// - createdTime / lastEditedTime: Creation and last modification timestamps for auditing
    ///   and UI display.
    /// - createdBy: A lightweight representation of the user who authored the comment.
    /// - richText: The rich text content supporting formatting, links, and mentions.
    /// - attachments: Optional attachments that can be added to a comment.
    /// - displayName: A custom display name for the author of the comment.
    ///
    /// Codable behavior:
    /// - Uses snake_case key mapping to align with Notion API response fields.
    ///
    /// Thread-safety and value semantics:
    /// - Conforms to `Sendable` and `Equatable`, making it suitable for use in Swift Concurrency
    ///   contexts and for reliable equality checks in testing or state management.
